# 20.7 Lab: Teletext

## Instructions 
Figure 20-12 shows a snapshot from the Teletext program. The program
continuously scrolls up a list of headlines. The user can add a headline, by typing it
in the provided text input field. The line will be added after the blank line that
follows “Today’s headlines.” The user can also delete a headline by entering “d.”
The next headline after the top one will be deleted. Run `Teletext` by clicking on the
`Teletext.jar` file in `JM\Ch20\Teletext`.

Figure 20-13 shows the class diagram for the Teletext program. The program keeps
the headlines in a doubly-linked circular list. (Circular lists are not used very often;
this is a rare occasion where we can benefit from one.) The list is implemented in the
`TeletextList` class. Your task is to fill in the missing code in that class.
`TeletextList.java` is located in `JM\Ch20\Teletext`.

## Overview
This lab isn't too hard as its just a simple Circular Doubly Linked List but the wording can be a bit hard to understand at first.

## TeletextList
This is the file which you will be modifying your code in.

### Fields 

**heading** `ListNode2<String>`

This will store the ListNode2 that has the value "Today's headlines"

**topNode** `ListNode2<String>`

This will hold the current ListNode2 that is being displayed 

### Methods/Functions 

TeletextList (`String[] headlines`) : `constructor`

This constructor will init the LinkList, First create a `ListNode2` and store the value `"Today's headlines"`. Then store the reference in the `heading` field. 
Create two `ListNode2` and store the value `""` in them. Then set the prev of `heading` to one of the Nodes and the next of `heading` to another. 
!!!Reminder
    make sure you remember to set the next and prev for both Empty ListNode2 so it creates an Circular Doubly Linked List
This will create this section
