# 20.7 Lab: Teletext

Figure 20-12 shows a snapshot from the Teletext program. The program
continuously scrolls up a list of headlines. The user can add a headline, by typing it
in the provided text input field. The line will be added after the blank line that
follows “Today’s headlines.” The user can also delete a headline by entering “d.”
The next headline after the top one will be deleted. Run `Teletext` by clicking on the
`Teletext.jar` file in `JM\Ch20\Teletext`.

Figure 20-13 shows the class diagram for the Teletext program. The program keeps
the headlines in a doubly-linked circular list. (Circular lists are not used very often;
this is a rare occasion where we can benefit from one.) The list is implemented in the
`TeletextList` class. Your task is to fill in the missing code in that class.
`TeletextList.java` is located in `JM\Ch20\Teletext`.
