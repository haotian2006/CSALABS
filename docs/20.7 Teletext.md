# 20.7 Lab: Teletext

>Difficulty: <span style="color:orange">Complicated</span> (30 Minutes)

## Instructions 
Figure 20-12 shows a snapshot from the Teletext program. The program
continuously scrolls up a list of headlines. The user can add a headline, by typing it
in the provided text input field. The line will be added after the blank line that
follows “Today’s headlines.” The user can also delete a headline by entering “d.”
The next headline after the top one will be deleted. Run `Teletext` by clicking on the
`Teletext.jar` file in `JM\Ch20\Teletext`.

Figure 20-13 shows the class diagram for the Teletext program. The program keeps
the headlines in a doubly-linked circular list. (Circular lists are not used very often;
this is a rare occasion where we can benefit from one.) The list is implemented in the
`TeletextList` class. Your task is to fill in the missing code in that class.
`TeletextList.java` is located in `JM\Ch20\Teletext`.

## Overview
This lab isn't too hard as its just a simple Circular Doubly Linked List but the wording can be a bit hard to understand at first.

## TeletextList
This is the file which you will be modifying your code in.

### ---Fields---

### **heading** `ListNode2<String>`

This will store the ListNode2 that has the value "Today's headlines"

### **topNode** `ListNode2<String>`

This will hold the current ListNode2 that is being displayed 

### ---Methods/Functions--- 

### **TeletextList**(`String[] headlines`) : `constructor`

This constructor will init the LinkList, First create a `ListNode2` and store the value `"Today's headlines"`. Then store the reference in the `heading` field. 
Create two `ListNode2` and store the value `""` in them. Then set the prev of `heading` to one of the Nodes and the next of `heading` to another. 
This will create this section of the blog

After doing that iterate through `headlines` which is an string array and insert each string into the Circular Doubly Linked List, 

!!!Reminder
    make sure you remember to set the next and prev for both Empty ListNode2 and for each of the headlines in the string array so it creates an Circular Doubly Linked List

Lastly set `topNode` to `heading`
### **insert**(`String msg`) : `void`

This method inserts a new `ListNode2` with the msg after the `"" ListNode2` of the `heading ListNode2`

You would start by first finding the `"" ListNode2` by starting with `heading` and use `.getNext()` to get the `"" ListNode2`
Once you have that `ListNode2` you would create a new `ListNode2` with the value of msg and set the prev to the `"" ListNode2`
and set next to the next `ListNode2` of the `"" ListNode2`. After you do that you want to update the next value for `"" ListNode2` and the prev value for `("" ListNode2).getNext()`

### **delete**() : `void`

deletes the next Node after `topNode` unless the next Node is the `heading` or one of the `"" ListNode2` 

Get the nextNode after topNode and do an if check to see if its either the `ListNode2` before/after `heading` or if is `heading`. If any of these conditions pass then don't delete the nextNode and do nothing. If it does pass then remove the `ListNode2` by settings the prevNode's next to nextNode and nextNode's prev to prevNode

### **scrollUp**() : `void`

sets topNode to the nextNode

### **addBefore**(ListNode2<String> node, String msg ) : `ListNode2<String>`
this method is already done for you 

### **addAfter**(ListNode2<String> node, String msg ) : `ListNode2<String>`
similar to addBefore but instead of before you do after

Look at addBefore's code

### **remove**(ListNode2<String> node, String msg) : `void`
similar to delete but delete the given node instead
