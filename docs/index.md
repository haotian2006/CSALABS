## Hello
This will be a resource for any one that is in LHS's CSA program. I will try to cover the Second Semester only as this was an idea that I though of in the first semester. 

[Raw MD files](https://github.com/haotian2006/CSALABS/tree/main/docs)

???+info "Difficulties"
    These are assigned to each lab and is rated on how difficult it would be for an intermediate programer
    
    ><span style="color:lightgreen">simple</span> - Not too bad
   
    ><span style="color:orange">Complicated</span> - A bit hard, but other wise not that bad
    
    ><span style="color:red">Complex</span> - Was confusing/Instructions was unclear

## Disclaimer
These docs will **not** provide the full code/solution of the labs but rather to help aid you with the labs. Also don't expect all labs to be documented here
